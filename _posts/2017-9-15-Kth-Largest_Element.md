# Kth Largest Element in an Array
## Question
Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

For example,
Given `[3,2,1,5,6,4]` and k = 2, return 5.

**Note:**   
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.
